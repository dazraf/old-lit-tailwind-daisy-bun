/**
 Prevent flasing of unstyled components (FUOC). 
 In this skeleton, we aim to have the integrity of shadow dom to allow us to do slots, as well as isolating any per-component styles.
 This is achieved using the `TailwindElement` class, which directly loads the application styles (including tailwind and daisy) once
 and injects it into the web-component style. This injection is async, hence why we typically would see a flashing of unstyled components.
 The following CSS selector hides these components until they are styled.
